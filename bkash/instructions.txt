##First create the cluster
##Then start by creating the namespace
kubectl create namespace bkash

#Initialize Project
yarn install

##Build instructions
##Before this, it might be necessary to use docker login 
## The credentials are nazmul4532brainstation and Void@4532 for dockerhub
## If you want to change repository, the service yaml file needs to be updated

##Normally build and push images using these
docker build -t nazmul4532brainstation/bkash-service:latest .
docker push nazmul4532brainstation/bkash-service:latest

##But Since I am building the image on a MacOS and running it on LinuxOs, I have to run
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t nazmul4532brainstation/bkash-service:latest .
docker push nazmul4532brainstation/bkash-service:latest

### The images built on your system might take up a lot of storage so sometimes run this command
docker system prune -a -f
## This will delete any unnecessary and unused docker resource from your device

##Deployment instructions
## If you make any changes to the service
## Just build it again and restart the deployment

kubectl apply -n bkash -f bkash-service.yaml
kubectl apply -n bkash -f bkash-ingress.yaml
